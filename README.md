Python/selenium to make Anylead even more powerful
Anylead is a powerful lead generation tool: http://try.anyleads.com/FabianMaume
It enable to get a list of employee based one company domain name. However this functionality is limited to batches of 100 domains. That is why I developed this automation to process wider domain list easily.

# The script require:
  Python 3 with selenium & pandas packages
  Chrome webbrother
  Proper set up of selenium on your computer (notably the path chrome driver set up in environment variables)
